The application created to compare the data from the input .csv file with existing data from the DB 
and generate new document only with the not registered in DB data.

Represents the microservices architecture pattern and consist of three containerized services assembled by Docker compose:

- db service - PostgreSQL DB
- web service - retreives existing data form the DB and add new data.
- s service  - reads .csv input from form, requests existing data from the 'web' service via HTTP GET request, compares existing data and new one,
creates output file only with not existing in database data, sends HTTP POST request to 'web' service with the same one to register that in DB.

* API of 'web' service created with Django Rest Framework.
